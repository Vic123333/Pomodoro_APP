# Pomodoro

A simple **Pomodoro Timer** built using Python's Tkinter for the user interface. This app helps in managing time effectively by using the Pomodoro Technique — breaking work into intervals (usually 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.

## Features
- **Work Timer**: Default is set to 25 minutes for focused work.
- **Short Break**: 5-minute break after each work interval.
- **Long Break**: 20-minute break after every four work intervals.
- **Visual Countdown**: Displays the remaining time for both work and break intervals.
- **Session Tracking**: Shows checkmarks (`✔`) for completed work sessions.
- **Sound Alert**: (Optional) Use a sound to notify the user when the timer ends (feature commented out in the code).
